# Weather-Database
Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) cloud based API. I created a program to extract data in a certain time frame and store on to my pc. Where I would create a CSV Excel file to analyze the requested data. After reviewing and cleansing the data, I created a xlsx workbook file for the finished product after downloading the humidity and temperature. I used Python and the embedded SQL commands in python for data retrieval.
